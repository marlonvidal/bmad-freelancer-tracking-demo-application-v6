# Time-Tracking Kanban App for Solo Freelancers Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable solo freelancers to accurately track billable hours and increase revenue through integrated time tracking
- Reduce context switching and administrative overhead by combining task management with time tracking in a single workflow
- Provide freelancer-specific features (billable hours, client context, revenue tracking) without requiring paid customization tiers
- Deliver a desktop-first kanban experience optimized for solo freelancer workflows
- Increase productivity through streamlined task and time management

### Background Context

Solo freelancers currently struggle with fragmented workflows, using generic tools like Asana and Trello that weren't designed for their specific needs. These tools require paid tiers for customization and keep time tracking separate from task management, creating friction that reduces productivity and leads to lost billable hours. The current landscape lacks an affordable, freelancer-focused solution that combines kanban task visualization with integrated time tracking.

This PRD addresses the core problem: freelancers need a single tool that understands their workflow—managing multiple clients and projects simultaneously, distinguishing billable from non-billable work, and providing visibility into revenue potential. By combining kanban task management with built-in time tracking, we eliminate context switching and administrative overhead while ensuring accurate capture of billable hours.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The application prioritizes minimal cognitive load and streamlined workflows for solo freelancers. The primary interface centers around a clean, uncluttered kanban board that serves as the command center for both task management and time tracking. Every interaction is designed to reduce friction—users can start tracking time, move tasks, and mark work as billable with single actions. The visual design emphasizes clarity and efficiency, using color coding and visual hierarchy to help users quickly understand task status, client context, and billable vs non-billable work at a glance.

The experience is optimized for desktop workflows where users spend extended periods managing multiple clients and projects. The interface supports deep focus work by minimizing distractions while providing immediate access to critical information (active timer, revenue potential, time spent). Dark mode reduces eye strain during long work sessions, and the design maintains consistency across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Kanban-First Navigation**: The kanban board is the primary interface—all core actions (task creation, time tracking, task movement) happen directly on the board without requiring navigation to separate screens.

**One-Tap Actions**: Critical actions (start timer, move task, toggle billable) are accessible with single clicks/taps directly on task cards. No multi-step workflows for common operations.

**Drag-and-Drop**: Task movement between columns uses intuitive drag-and-drop with visual feedback. The interaction feels fluid and responsive, supporting rapid task organization.

**Contextual Information Display**: Task cards show essential information (title, client/project, timer status, time spent, billable indicator) without requiring expansion. Details are available on-demand but don't clutter the primary view.

**Visual Status Indicators**: Color coding and visual indicators communicate status instantly—active timers, billable tasks, client assignments, and task priority are immediately recognizable through consistent visual language.

**Board Customization**: UI controls for adding, removing, and reordering kanban columns with drag-and-drop column management.

**Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power users can navigate and perform actions via keyboard shortcuts, reducing reliance on mouse/trackpad for common operations.

### Core Screens and Views

1. **Main Kanban Board**: The primary workspace displaying tasks organized in customizable columns (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done). Task cards show key information and timer controls.

2. **Task Detail/Edit View**: Side panel for viewing/editing task details (title, description, due date, priority, tags, client/project assignment, time estimates, billable toggle).

3. **Client Management**: Inline creation and management directly from the kanban board (dropdown/quick-add for creating clients with name, default hourly rate, contact info). No separate screen required.

4. **Project Management**: Inline creation and organization of tasks under projects directly from the kanban board. No separate screen required.

5. **Revenue Dashboard**: View showing daily, weekly, and monthly revenue summaries with breakdowns by client/project. Accessible from main board.

6. **Settings/Preferences**: Application settings including dark mode toggle, keyboard shortcuts configuration, export options, and backup/restore functionality.

7. **Onboarding/Setup Wizard**: Multi-step wizard for first-time users to set up initial client, project, board columns, and sample task with timer demo.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application complies with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring:
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Sufficient color contrast ratios for text and UI elements
- Screen reader compatibility for task information and status
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Alternative text for icons and visual indicators
- Logical reading order and semantic HTML structure

### Branding

No specific branding requirements identified. The design should prioritize clarity, professionalism, and minimalism suitable for freelancer workflows. Visual style should be clean and modern without distracting decorative elements. Color palette uses a neutral, professional palette that supports clear visual distinction between clients, priorities, and statuses while maintaining accessibility standards.

### Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

Web-based application optimized for desktop browsers, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms through modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). The interface is designed for desktop browser use with responsive layout that adapts to different window sizes, supporting both full-screen and windowed browser modes. Primary interaction model assumes mouse/trackpad and keyboard input. Application works as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline functionality. MVP supports a single kanban board per user (multiple boards deferred to post-MVP).

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing all application code, build configuration, and documentation. This structure supports the web application's unified codebase and simplifies deployment processes. No separate frontend/backend repositories needed for this local-first web application.

### Service Architecture

**Web Application Architecture**: This is a single-page web application (SPA) optimized for desktop browser use. The application uses a local-first architecture where all data processing and storage happens in the user's browser. No backend services, APIs, or cloud infrastructure required for MVP. The application should work as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to support offline functionality.

**Component Architecture**: The application follows a component-based architecture using React with clear separation between:
- UI Layer (kanban board, task cards, side panels, views)
- Business Logic Layer (task management, time tracking, revenue calculations)
- Data Layer (local database access, data persistence)

**State Management**: Application state managed locally using React Context API. No external state synchronization needed since all data is local. React Context provides sufficient state management for the application's scope without requiring additional state management libraries.

### Testing Requirements

**Full Testing Pyramid**: The application requires comprehensive testing across all levels:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components, business logic functions, time tracking calculations, revenue calculations, data model operations
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between UI components, data layer operations, timer functionality with background operation, drag-and-drop interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows (create task, start timer, move task, view revenue dashboard, export data)
- **Manual Testing Convenience Methods**: Provide CLI tools or test utilities for quickly setting up test data, verifying data integrity, and testing edge cases

**Rationale**: Given the critical nature of time tracking (billable hours = revenue), comprehensive testing is essential. Users must trust the application to accurately track time and calculate revenue. Integration tests ensure timer functionality works correctly when app is minimized. E2E tests validate complete workflows. Manual testing methods support QA verification and debugging.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Framework**: Use React for UI development, leveraging component-based architecture for kanban board, task cards, and views. React provides:
- Smooth drag-and-drop interactions (60fps requirement) via libraries like react-beautiful-dnd or @dnd-kit
- Efficient rendering of 1000+ tasks with React's virtual DOM and optimization techniques
- Dark mode theming via CSS variables and context
- Responsive layout for different browser window sizes

**State Management**: Use React Context API for application state management. React Context provides sufficient state management for the application's scope without requiring additional state management libraries like Redux. Context providers will manage: task state, timer state, client/project data, UI preferences (dark mode), and revenue calculations.

**Local Database**: Use IndexedDB (browser's built-in database) for local data storage. IndexedDB provides:
- Reliable storage for structured data (tasks, clients, projects, time entries)
- Efficient querying for filtering and searching tasks
- Browser-native, no external dependencies
- Supports complex queries for revenue calculations and analytics
- Works offline and persists across browser sessions
- Alternative consideration: Use a wrapper library like Dexie.js for easier IndexedDB API

**Timer Implementation**: Browser-based timer using JavaScript's setInterval/requestAnimationFrame APIs. Timer continues running when browser tab is active. For background operation when tab is not active, use Web Workers or Service Workers to maintain timer accuracy. Note: Browser limitations may affect timer accuracy when tab is inactive, but this is acceptable for MVP.

**Build Tool**: Use Vite as the build tool and development server. Vite provides:
- Fast development server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Optimized production builds
- Modern ES modules support
- Excellent React integration
- Fast build times
- Built-in TypeScript support (if TypeScript is used)

**Testing Framework**: Use Jest for unit and integration testing. Jest provides:
- Comprehensive testing utilities for React components
- Snapshot testing for UI components
- Mocking capabilities for timer functions and browser APIs
- Code coverage reporting
- Fast test execution

**Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Implement PWA capabilities to support offline functionality:
- Service Worker for offline access and background timer operation
- Web App Manifest for installable application experience
- Cache strategies for application assets and data

**Data Export**: CSV and JSON export functionality using browser-based file download APIs. Handle large datasets efficiently using blob URLs and streaming where possible. Consider using libraries like PapaParse for CSV generation.

**Deployment**: Static web application deployment to hosting platforms (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or similar). No server-side rendering required. Consider automated deployment via CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for consistent releases.

**Performance Optimization**: Implement virtual scrolling or pagination for kanban board to handle 1000+ tasks efficiently. Use React.memo and useMemo for component optimization. Lazy loading for task details and side panels. Optimize re-renders to maintain 60fps during interactions. Consider libraries like react-window or react-virtualized for virtual scrolling.

**Accessibility Implementation**: Ensure React components and UI libraries support WCAG 2.1 AA requirements including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and proper ARIA labels. Use semantic HTML and accessible component libraries where possible.
